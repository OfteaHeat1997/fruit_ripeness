### Accuracy by Class
| Class | Correct | Total | Accuracy |
|-------|---------|-------|----------|
| rottenbanana | 187 | 187 | **100.0%** ✅ |
| freshapples | 0 | 114 | **0.0%** ❌ |

### Prediction Distribution
```
Model predictions: rottenbanana: 855/855 (100.0%) 🚨
```

**The model ALWAYS predicts "rottenbanana" - a classic symptom of severe class imbalance!**

---

## 💡 What Went Wrong?

### Root Cause: Class Imbalance
The model learned to always predict "rottenbanana" because:
1. **Training data imbalance** - "rottenbanana" likely over-represented
2. **No class weighting** - Model not penalized for ignoring minority classes
3. **Optimization shortcut** - Easier to guess one class than learn features

### Evidence
- Low confidence (~47%) indicates the model is not confident
- Probability distributions are relatively flat
- High entropy shows uncertainty in predictions

---

## 🛠️ How to Fix This

### Option 1: Run the Jupyter Notebook (Recommended)
```bash
jupyter notebook Dataset_Analysis_Results.ipynb
```

The notebook includes:
1. ✅ Complete visualizations (6 different charts)
2. ✅ Training data imbalance analysis
3. ✅ Individual prediction exploration
4. ✅ Recommended class weights
5. ✅ Complete retraining script

### Option 2: Retrain Model Directly
```bash
python retrain_model_balanced.py
```

This script will:
- Calculate proper class weights automatically
- Apply data augmentation
- Use two-phase training (fast → fine-tuning)
- Save best model during training
- Generate new model with balanced predictions

### Expected Improvements
With proper class balancing:
- **Target Accuracy:** 75-90% (vs current 21.87%)
- **Balanced Predictions:** All classes predicted (vs only 1)
- **Higher Confidence:** 70-90% (vs current 47%)

## 📊 Using the Analysis Files

### 1. Explore Individual Predictions
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load results
df = pd.read_csv('dataset_analysis_results.csv')

# View a specific prediction
sample = df.iloc[0]
print(f"Image: {sample['image_name']}")
print(f"Ground Truth: {sample['ground_truth']}")
print(f"Predicted: {sample['predicted_label']} ({sample['confidence']*100:.1f}%)")

# Parse probability distribution
import ast
all_scores = ast.literal_eval(sample['all_scores'])
for label, prob in sorted(all_scores.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True):
    print(f"  {label}: {prob*100:.2f}%")
```

### 2. Generate Custom Visualizations
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Confusion matrix
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(df['ground_truth'], df['predicted_label'])

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.ylabel('True Label')
plt.xlabel('Predicted Label')
plt.show()
```

### 3. Filter by Class
```python
# Get all freshapples predictions
freshapples = df[df['ground_truth'] == 'freshapples']

print(f"Freshapples: {len(freshapples)} images")
print(f"Correctly predicted: {freshapples['correct'].sum()}")
print(f"Average confidence: {freshapples['confidence'].mean()*100:.2f}%")
```

## ❓ FAQ

### Why is accuracy so low?
The model always predicts "rottenbanana" due to class imbalance during training.

### Can this be fixed?
Yes! Retraining with proper class weights should achieve 75-90% accuracy.

### How long does retraining take?
Approximately 1-2 hours with GPU (depends on epochs and dataset size).

### Will the Flask/Streamlit apps still work?
Yes, but they'll give wrong predictions. Replace the model after retraining.

### Should I collect more data?
After retraining, evaluate performance. If still poor on certain classes, collect more samples for those classes.
