"""
Model Loader and Prediction Module for Fruit Ripeness Classification

This module handles loading the trained MobileNetV2 deep learning model and
provides prediction functionality. It implements lazy loading to prevent
startup delays in Flask and Streamlit applications.

Key Features:
- Lazy loading: Model loads only when first prediction is requested
- GPU acceleration: Automatically uses GPU if available via TensorFlow
- Efficient memory usage: Model loaded once and reused for all predictions
- Standard input size: Resizes all images to 224x224 for MobileNetV2

Model Details:
- Architecture: MobileNetV2 (transfer learning)
- Size: 9.3 MB
- Classes: 9 (3 fruits × 3 ripeness levels)
- Input: RGB images, 224×224 pixels
- Output: Probability distribution over 9 classes

# ===== Path Configuration =====

# Get the project root directory (parent of src/)
# This allows the module to find the model files regardless of where it's called from
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))

# Path to the trained MobileNetV2 model file
# The model was trained to classify 9 fruit ripeness categories

)

# Path to the labels file containing class names
# Each line in labels.txt represents one class (e.g., "freshapples", "rottenbanana")

# ===== Model Configuration =====

# MobileNetV2 expects 224×224 pixel input images
# All input images will be resized to this dimension
IMG_SIZE = (224, 224)

# ===== Lazy Loading Variables =====

# Global variables to store the model and labels after first load
# Using None initially means they haven't been loaded yet
# This prevents loading the 9.3 MB model at import time, which would:
# - Slow down Flask/Streamlit startup (20-30 seconds)
# - Use GPU memory before it's needed
# - Block the application during initialization

def _load_model_and_labels():
    """
    Lazy load the model and labels on first use.

    This function implements the lazy loading pattern:
    - Checks if model/labels are already loaded
    - If not, loads them from disk
    - Caches them in global variables for future use
    - Returns the loaded model and labels

    The lazy loading approach:
    1. Keeps imports fast (important for Streamlit auto-reload)
    2. Loads model only when first prediction is requested
    3. Reuses the loaded model for all subsequent predictions
    4. GPU allocation happens here, not at import time

    Returns:
        tuple: (model, labels)
            - model: Loaded Keras/TensorFlow model ready for predictions
            - labels: List of class names (e.g., ['freshapples', 'rottenbanana', ...])

    GPU Behavior:
    - If GPU is available, TensorFlow automatically loads model to GPU memory
    - First load takes ~20-30 seconds (one-time cost)
    - GPU significantly speeds up predictions (0.1-0.5s vs 2-5s on CPU)

def predict_image(img: Image.Image) -> dict:
    """
    Predict the ripeness class of a fruit image using the MobileNetV2 model.

    This function performs the complete prediction pipeline:
    1. Loads the model (if not already loaded - lazy loading)
    2. Resizes the image to required dimensions (224×224)
    3. Preprocesses the image (normalization)
    4. Runs inference through the neural network
    5. Returns the predicted class and confidence scores

    Args:
        img (PIL.Image.Image): Input image in RGB format
            - Should contain a fruit (apple, banana, or orange)
            - Any size accepted (will be resized internally)
            - Format: PIL Image object

    Returns:
        dict: Prediction results with three keys:
            - "label" (str): Predicted class name
                Examples: "freshapples", "rottenbanana", "unripe orange"
            - "score" (float): Confidence score for predicted class (0.0 to 1.0)
                Higher values indicate more confidence
                Example: 0.95 means 95% confident
            - "all_scores" (dict): Probability for each class
                Keys: all 9 class names
                Values: probability for that class (0.0 to 1.0)
                All values sum to 1.0

    Example:
        >>> from PIL import Image
        >>> img = Image.open("apple.jpg")
        >>> result = predict_image(img)
        >>> print(result)
        {
            "label": "freshapples",
            "score": 0.9234,
            "all_scores": {
                "freshapples": 0.9234,
                "freshbanana": 0.0123,
                ...
            }
        }

    Performance:
        - First call: ~20-30 seconds (model loading to GPU)
        - Subsequent calls: ~0.1-0.5 seconds (GPU) or 2-5 seconds (CPU)

    GPU Acceleration:
        - Automatically uses GPU if TensorFlow detects one
        - GPU provides 10-50x speedup over CPU
        - No code changes needed - TensorFlow handles it automatically
    """
    # ===== Step 1: Load Model and Labels =====
    # Load model and labels using lazy loading
    # This only loads once on first call, then reuses the cached model
    model, labels = _load_model_and_labels()

    # ===== Step 2: Resize Image =====
    # Resize to 224×224 pixels (MobileNetV2 requirement)
    # Uses PIL's LANCZOS resampling for high quality
    img_resized = img.resize(IMG_SIZE)

    # ===== Step 3: Convert to NumPy Array =====
    # Convert PIL Image to NumPy array for TensorFlow
    # Shape after conversion: (224, 224, 3) - height, width, RGB channels
    img_array = keras_image.img_to_array(img_resized)

    # Add batch dimension: (224, 224, 3) -> (1, 224, 224, 3)
    # Neural networks expect batches, even when processing single images
    # The '1' means batch size of 1 (one image)
    img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)

    # ===== Step 4: Normalize Pixel Values =====
    # Original pixel values are in range [0, 255]
    # MobileNetV2 expects values in range [-1, 1]
    # Formula: (pixel / 127.5) - 1.0
    #   - Dividing by 127.5 scales to [0, 2]
    #   - Subtracting 1.0 shifts to [-1, 1]
    img_array = img_array / 127.5 - 1.0

    # ===== Step 5: Run Inference =====
    # Pass the preprocessed image through the neural network
    # Returns probability distribution over all 9 classes
    # Shape of predictions: (1, 9) - 1 image, 9 class probabilities
    # verbose=0 suppresses TensorFlow progress output
    predictions = model.predict(img_array, verbose=0)

    # ===== Step 6: Extract Predicted Class =====
    # Find the index of the class with highest probability
    # np.argmax returns the index (0-8) of the maximum value
    predicted_idx = np.argmax(predictions[0])

    # Get the confidence score (probability) for the predicted class
    # Convert numpy float32 to Python float for JSON serialization
    confidence = float(predictions[0][predicted_idx])

    # Get the class name using the predicted index
    # Example: if predicted_idx=0 and labels[0]="freshapples", then predicted_label="freshapples"
    predicted_label = labels[predicted_idx]

    # ===== Step 7: Create Dictionary of All Scores =====
    # Build a dictionary mapping each class name to its probability
    # This allows users to see how confident the model is for each class
    # Example: {"freshapples": 0.92, "rottenbanana": 0.01, ...}
    all_scores = {labels[i]: float(predictions[0][i]) for i in range(len(labels))}

    # ===== Step 8: Return Results =====
    # Return structured dictionary with prediction results
    return {
        "label": predicted_label,      # Most likely class
        "score": confidence,             # Confidence in that class
        "all_scores": all_scores         # Probabilities for all classes
    }
